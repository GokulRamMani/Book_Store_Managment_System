## Abstract <a name = "Abstract"></a>
The aim is to automate its existing manual system with the help of computerized equipment and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy access and manipulation the same. Basically,the project describes how to manage for good performance and better services for the clients.

## Introduction
The electricity billing system has been developed to override the problems prevailing in the practicing manual system. This software is supported to eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardship faced by this existing system. Moreover, this system is designed for the particular need of the company to carry out operations in a smooth and effective manner. The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data it also provides error messages while entering invalid data. No formal knowledge is needed for the user to use this system.

Thus by this, it proves it is a user-friendly electricity billing system, as described above, can lead to an error-free, secure, reliable and fast management system. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities instead concentrate on record-keeping thus it will help organizations in better utilization of resources. Every organization, whether big or small has challenges to overcome and manage the information of unit energy, electricity, store record, connection, electricity board, and every electricity billing system.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you to develop the Electricity Billing System project in java using (GUI) Graphical User Interface, Java Swing and Java awt.

Steps to Develop a EBS usng Java GUI

### Installing

1. NetBeans Installation
2. Create a project file in beans
3. Drag and Drop GUIs
4. Button Configuration

NetBeans Installation

NetBeans IDE is a free open - Source, Cross - plte from integrated Decelopment Environment with built-in support the JAVA programming language. it can run any machine which consists of the jva virtual machine. it consists of many features for application development as follows:
•Drag & Drop Graphical User Interface (GUI) Creation.

•Excellent editing (advanced source code editor)

•Web-service

•Excellent debugging

•Wizards, code generation and management tools, and many more.

Step 1: You need to have a setup file of the NetBeans JAVA into your setup.

Step 2: If you didn’t have the setup you can download from the following link:

https://netbeans.org/images_www/v6/download/community/8.2

step 3: You can download any type of setup as per your requirements from the above mentionwebpage.

Step 4. Right-click on the setup or you can Double-Click on the setup by using the mouse.

Step 5.Click on the next option

Create a Project File in beans
Launch the NetBeans IDE

1.In the NetBeans IDE,
Click

File--New Project--Java--Java Application.

2.After creating the project go to the source package richt click new and select the JFrame
Example:

Source Package--New--JFrame

3.In the Name and Location page of the wizard, do the following

 File/Folder. In the New File wizard, under Categories, select NetBeans Module Development. Under File Types, select Window Component. Click Next.




## Running the file <a name = "file"></a>
After completing the project select the file right click it and choose Run.

After that the application will open we can do bill calculationg parts in the new opened window.

we can able to print the bill as three formats

1.Fax

2.word document

3.PDF file.

Its better we choose the file as in PDF format.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why


Give an example
## Electricty Billing System Usage <a name = "electricty_billingsystem_usage"></a>
It has three major features.

1.Text field:- In this project there are three main text field. In first one is Customer Id in which we have to fill Customer Id in second one is for Customer Name in this we have to fill customer Name and in the third one is for Unit which is consumed by the customer

2.Cal Button:- Cal Button calculate the gross amount of the unit which consumed by the customer and using lava code it calculate the total bill amount. In this project for different- different unit range there is different rate of charge according to our given data

<<<<<<< HEAD
## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
