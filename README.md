# Book_Store_Managment_System

Book Store Management System is a web application to automate all kinds of operations in the bookshop. The purpose of this software was s to manage the books in the book store. Generally, it includes the Order Processing, Stock Management and Accounts Management. We developed this software to maintains records of sales, purchase and staff records. This project developed using ASP.NET as front end and SQL Server as Back end. Here we are try to develop such type system which is provide the automation on the any type of the bookshop. That means a shop which has the type system which provides the facility to the customers of the shop to purchase the books from the shop without¬†any¬†complexity.

using spring boot.

## Abstract <a name = "Abstract"></a>

This application based on the Internet that aims at all levels of management providing information of an organization. This system can be used as an information management system for the bookstore.

This software is very helpful for maintain the records of sales and this system keeps all the record of books, receipts, sales, inventory¬†and¬†stocks.

## Language & Tools <a name = "language&tools"></a>

- JAVA -- SPRING BOOT (spring boot dev tools, spring web, thymeleaf, spring data JPA)
- SQL -- H2 DATABASE
- MYSQL driver(optional)

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you to develop the Book Store Management web application using spring boot, Thymeleaf, JPA, h2 database.
Steps to Develop a BSM usng Spring boot.

### Installing

1. Spring initializer
2. Spring tool suit Installation
3. Create a project file in the Spring tool suit
4. Creation of H2 database from Spring tool suit

#Spring initializer

A spring initializer is a tool that helps you create a spring project with the desired dependencies and configuration. There are a few ways to use a spring initializer for a maven project:

You can go to https://start.spring.io and let the Initializr generate a Maven project for you with the desired dependencies123. You will get a zip file which you can then unpack in your dev folder. Then open Intellij and select File | New | Project from Existing Sources. (Or Import Project from the welcome screen)4.

You can use IntelliJ Ultimate Edition and create a Spring Boot Maven project directly from Eclipse3. File > New > Project‚Ä¶ > Spring Initilzr.
you can add dependencies in the spring initializer itself spring web, thymelef, spring data JPA, MYSQL driver, spring boot dev tools e.t.c.

#Spring tool suit Installation

First, need to download the Spring Tool Suite 4 package from the official website https://spring.io/tools. You can choose the package according to your operating system and preferred coding environment (Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, or Theia IDE)1.
Next, you need to copy the downloaded file to the ‚Äú/opt‚Äù folder and unzip it. You can use the following command to move and unzip the file (assuming you are using Linux and Eclipse):
sudo mv spring-tool-suite-4-4.14.0.RELEASE-e4.23.0-linux.gtk.x86_64.tar.gz /opt/
sudo tar -xvzf /opt/spring-tool-suite-4-4.14.0.RELEASE-e4.23.0-linux.gtk.x86_64.tar.gz
Copy
After that, you can run the SpringToolSuite4 application file from the extracted folder to launch STS 423. You will be asked to select a workspace directory where your projects will be stored.
Finally, you can start creating and running Spring Boot projects using STS 4. You can use the Spring Initializr integration to generate a project with the desired dependencies and configuration

#Create a project file in the Spring tool suit

First, you need to open the STS and click on the File menu -> New -> Spring Starter Project. This will open a wizard where you can choose the service URL, name, type, language, group, artifact, version, description, package and dependencies for your project12.
Next, you need to click on the Next button and select the Spring Boot version and the dependencies that you want to use for your project. You can search and add dependencies from the list or use the Spring Initializr website to generate a custom project13.
After that, you need to click on the Finish button and wait for STS to download and import all the required files for your project. You will see a welcome screen after your project is created successfully

#Creation of H2 database from Spring tool suit

you can run your Spring Boot application and access the H2 console in your browser by going to http://localhost:8080/h2-console (or http://localhost:8080/h2-console if you are using a different port). You will see a login screen where you can enter the same datasource URL, username and password that you configured in your application.properties file. Then click Connect to connect to your H2 database12.

Finally, you can create tables and perform CRUD operations on your H2 database using SQL scripts or JPA entities. For example, you can create a data.sql file under src/main/resources directory and write some SQL statements to create and populate a table2. Or you can create a JPA entity class with annotations like @Entity, @Id, @Column etc. and let Spring Boot automatically create the table for you based on the entity.



## Book Store Management System Usage <a name = "book_store_management_system_usage"></a>
It has three major features.

1. Less time to search for the specified books.

2. Saving in stationary.

3. Proper and clean work.

4. Better search ability and¬†availability.
