Steps to Develop a BSM usng Spring boot.

### Installing

1. Spring initializer
2. Spring tool suit Installation
3. Create a project file in the Spring tool suit


Spring initializer

A spring initializer is a tool that helps you create a spring project with the desired dependencies and configuration. There are a few ways to use a spring initializer for a maven project:

You can go to https://start.spring.io and let the Initializr generate a Maven project for you with the desired dependencies123. You will get a zip file which you can then unpack in your dev folder. Then open Intellij and select File | New | Project from Existing Sources. (Or Import Project from the welcome screen)4.
You can use IntelliJ Ultimate Edition and create a Spring Boot Maven project directly from Eclipse3. File > New > Project‚Ä¶ > Spring Initilzr.
you can add dependencies in the spring initializer itself spring web, thymelef, spring data JPA, MYSQL driver, spring boot dev tools e.t.c.

 NetBeans Installation

NetBeans IDE is a free open - Source, Cross - plte from integrated Decelopment Environment with built-in support the JAVA programming language. it can run any machine which consists of the jva virtual machine. it consists of many features for application development as follows:
‚Ä¢Drag & Drop Graphical User Interface (GUI) Creation.

‚Ä¢Excellent editing (advanced source code editor)

‚Ä¢Web-service

‚Ä¢Excellent debugging

‚Ä¢Wizards, code generation and management tools, and many more.

 File/Folder. In the New File wizard, under Categories, select NetBeans Module Development. Under File Types, select Window Component. Click Next.




## Running the file <a name = "file"></a>
After completing the project select the file right click it and choose Run.

After that the application will open we can do bill calculationg parts in the new opened window.

we can able to print the bill as three formats

1.Fax

2.word document

3.PDF file.

Its better we choose the file as in PDF format.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why


Give an example
## Electricty Billing System Usage <a name = "electricty_billingsystem_usage"></a>
It has three major features.

1.Text field:- In this project there are three main text field. In first one is Customer Id in which we have to fill Customer Id in second one is for Customer Name in this we have to fill customer Name and in the third one is for Unit which is consumed by the customer
